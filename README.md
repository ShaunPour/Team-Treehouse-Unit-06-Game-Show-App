# Team-Treehouse-Unit-06-Game-Show-App

Build as part of my brief participation in the teamtreehouse front end web developer tech degree program. This project is a word guessing game where the user is given a phrase of a certain length, generated at random from an array of different options and attempts to guess the correct phrase.
Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives by one. When a letter is selected, it enters all versions of that letter in the phrase and disables the button so it cannot be used again for the duration of the currrent game.
